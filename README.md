# A Participatory Map: Huskies' favourite/meaningful spot

Created by Wendy Bu

This participatory map is for UW community and anyone who's interested in life in UW/Seattle. Users can contribute their local knowledge and stories by clicking on the map,
submitting their information, and viewing it represented as a husky icon.
Future students could view the comments made by current students and even alumnums to get to know more about UW campus and surroundings, and students' study and life expriencence at UW.

The map can be accessed [HERE](https://participatorymap-4832ac3959da.herokuapp.com/).
